## Examples without Docker
### Starting the server connection

To start the server and make him listen for incoming connections :

```bash
java -jar target/DAI-LAB-03-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server
```

Output:

```arduino
Server listening for connections on port: 1986
```

### Starting a client connection

To create a client connection on the remote server so you can identify yourself:

```bash
java -jar target/DAI-LAB-03-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Client -H localhost
```

Output:

```
COMMANDS: DELETE UPLOAD DOWNLOAD QUIT CONNECT LIST 
> CONNECT
Enter your pseudo:
```

The client will then have to enter his pseudo (Will ask you to re-enter it if you don't):

```
COMMANDS: DELETE UPLOAD DOWNLOAD QUIT CONNECT LIST 
> CONNECT
Enter your pseudo: 
Enter your pseudo: toto
Enter your email:
```

After that, the client must enter a valid email (checked by a regex on client and server side):

```
COMMANDS: DELETE UPLOAD DOWNLOAD QUIT CONNECT LIST 
> CONNECT
Enter your pseudo: 
Enter your pseudo: toto
Enter your email: toto@exemple.com
Connection successfull
>
```

After that, the CONNECT command ask for the connection and, if it is accepted, the client will be able to use the following commands at will:

- `DELETE <id>`: Delete the video with the <id> number 
- `LIST`: List all videos on the server
- `DOWNLOAD <id>`: Download the video with the <id> number 
- `UPLOAD`: Upload a video

#### Example with the command `LIST`:

```
> LIST
1) 3 Minute Timer - Displays a timer from 3 minutes to 0
2) Google Office tour - Visit of Google's building
3) Why is Switzerland home to so many billionaires - Documentary on Switzerland's billionaires
4) L'entretien de Choss - VidÃ©o de Choss passant un entretien
>
```

##### Example with the command `DOWNLOAD`:

```
> DOWNLOAD 1
Download complete !
```

The video with the number 1 will be downloaded in the client_data folder.


#### Example with the command `UPLOAD`:

```
> UPLOAD
Enter the title of the video: Titre test
Enter the description of the video: Titre description
Enter the path of the video file: test.mp4
Ready to receive video
Upload complete! Waiting for server confirmation...
Video uploaded successfully
> 
```

The video will be uploaded to the server and will be available for download. __The video to upload must be in the client_data folder.__


#### Example with the command `DELETE`:

```
> DELETE 5
Video deleted
> 
```

#### Example with the command `QUIT`:

```
> QUIT
See you soon :)
```

## Examples with Docker

You can also use Docker to run the application. First, create the Docker image and the network:

```bash
docker build -t ammar-app .
docker network create ammar-net
```

Then, start the server and the client in two different terminals:

```bash
docker run -p 1986:1986 -v ./server_data:/app/server_data \
  --network ammar-net --name ammar-server ammar-app Server
```

```bash
docker run -it -v ./client_data:/app/client_data \
  --network ammar-net ammar-app Client --host ammar-server --port 1986
```

Be sure to have the folders `server_data` and `client_data` in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

### Cleaning up

After you are done, you can stop and remove the containers and the network:

```bash
docker stop ammar-server
docker rm ammar-server
docker network rm ammar-net
```

## Building from Source

If you want to contribute or modify the application, follow these steps to build the project from the source.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HEIG-VD-S3-PW/DAI-LAB-03

cd DAI-LAB-03
```

Build the project: Use Maven to build the project and generate the JAR file.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Run the application: Once built, you can run the application using:

```bash
java -jar target/DAI-LAB-03-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Testing the application: You can also run the tests using Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```

---

## Adding new commands

To add a new command, you need to create a new class that extends the Command class and implement the validate, execute and receive commands. You can then add the command to the CommandRegistry class.

```java
@Override
public void validate(String[] args) throws CommandException {
    // Check the arguments and throw an exception if they are invalid
}

@Override
public CommandResponse execute(User user, StreamingVideo streamingVideo, String[] args) {
    // SERVER SIDE : Execute the command and return a response to the client
}

@Override
public void receive() {
    // CLIENT SIDE : Receive the response from the server
}
```

```java
public CommandRegistry(BufferedReader in, BufferedWriter out) {
    // ...
  registerCommand(new NewCommand());
}
```

Now your command is available to use in the application.

__Moreover, if you choose to contribute to the project by adding a new command, a diagram of the correct and wrong use of the command is required.__

### Adding a new process (client side only)

If you want to help the user to use the command correctly, you can add a new process to the command. To do this, you need to create a new class that extends the Process class and implement the execute method.

__Example of `CONNECT` command:__

```java
public class SignInClientProcess extends Process {
    
    public SignInClientProcess(BufferedReader in, BufferedWriter out) { super(in, out); }

    @Override
    public boolean execute() throws Exception {
        String pseudo = Utils.askForInput("Enter your pseudo: ", null);
        String email = Utils.askForInput("Enter your email: ", Utils::emailValidation);
        Utils.send(out, "CONNECT " + pseudo + " " + email);
        return true;
    }
}
```

The add a condition in the function `handleSpecialCommand` in the TCPClient class. 

The Process class helps guide users through command execution and enables the exchange of complex data beyond simple PING-PONG messages.
